    <ul >
<li>Ahmedabad, founded in 1411 by Sultan Ahmed Shah
The area where Ahmedabad stands was historically known
as Ashaval (or Ashapalli) and was inhabited as early as the 11th century.
<li>King Karandev I of the Solanki dynasty (from Anhilwara, modern Patan) 
conquered Ashaval and established a city called Karnavati on the banks of the 
Sabarmati River.
<li>The present city of Ahmedabad was founded by Sultan Ahmed Shah I of the Gujarat
Sultanate. He laid the foundation on February 26, 1411 AD, and officially
made it his capital on March 4, 1411. 
He named the city after himself, Ahmedabad, though some accounts suggest
he named it after four Muslim saints all bearing the name Ahmed.

<h3>Sultanate and Mughal Rule</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Under the Gujarat Sultanate (1411-1572), Ahmedabad flourished as a vital center for trade and commerce, particularly known for its textile industry, earning it the nickname "The Manchester of India."

        <li>In 1487, Mahmud Begada, Ahmed Shah's grandson, fortified the city with a substantial outer wall, complete with twelve gates and numerous bastions.

        <li>Ahmedabad experienced a brief decline between 1511 and 1572 when the capital was temporarily shifted to Champaner.

        <li>The city regained its prominence under the Mughal Empire after Emperor Akbar conquered Gujarat in 1573. During this period, Ahmedabad continued to thrive as a significant trading hub, with its textiles being exported even to Europe. Mughal rulers, including Shah Jahan, contributed to its architectural landscape.

<h3>Indian Independence Movement and Post-Independence</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ahmedabad played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement. Mahatma Gandhi established his Sabarmati Ashram in 1917 (initially Kochrab Ashram in 1915) on the banks of the Sabarmati River, which became a focal point for many nationalist activities, including the historic Dandi Salt March in 1930.

        <li>After India gained independence in 1947, Ahmedabad became part of the Bombay State.

        <li>In 1960, with the bifurcation of the Bombay State, Ahmedabad became the temporary capital of the newly formed state of Gujarat. However, the capital was later shifted to Gandhinagar in 1970.
